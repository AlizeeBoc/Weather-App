# Weather-App

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

## The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.  
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

### Specifications

#### Must haves

- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly
